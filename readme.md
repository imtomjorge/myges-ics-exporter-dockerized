MyGES ICS Exporter is a dockerized [version of this software](https://github.com/kidelag/agenda-ges). It will allow you to generate and serve an updated .ics file of your MyGES agenda, using your associatedcredentials. 
Created by kidelag, the whole installation process, has been simplified, and converted on a complete dockerized version.

# Configuration
The whole configuration process is pretty simple, let's get into it!
## üß∞ Requirements
- MyGES active credentials (used to login at myges.fr portal) - x64 architecture based
VM (no current ARM support) - Docker installed on your VM - Internet access on your VM
- Any free external port
## üîë Prepare our credentials
By default, all credentials are stored on myges.env file, located at root. Please edit
this file, and add your credentials and any nickname.  
It will be used to get your .ics file. ``` docker MYGES_USERNAME=jdoe MYGES_PASSWORD=MyStrongPassword
NICKNAME=JohnDoe ```
## üöÄ Launch our container
Simply run the following command: 
```docker run --env-file myges.env -d -p 8282:80
myges-ics-exporter-exp:latest``` 
Feel free to chose your port, and choose any other port than 8282. 
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Don't modify 80 port!**
## üîó Access to our .ics file
By default, your ICS file, will be served at the following URL:
```http://yourHostIP:8282/agenda-ges?name=YourNickname``` or your custom port and replace "YourNickname" by the one that you've defined on myges.env file.
## üìÖ Add .ics file to any calendar app
Now that you're calendar will be served on an .ics file, and constantly updated, let's add it to your calendar. 
- Google Calendar: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100 
- MacOS/iCloud: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202361 
- Nextcloud Cal: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/19/user_manual/pim/calendar.html 
Any other calendar app that support ICS import/subscription will work as expected.
